############ Forked by adam.liu for raspberry pi test ############ 

Quick scripts:
    a) compile the whole kernel: make.sh
    b) compile core kernel with simple way: make_normal.sh
    c) flash all contents into pi: flashall.sh
    d) flash vmlinux into pi: flashall_normal.sh

PS: the ip address of my raspberry pi is 192.168.2.107, you may need to
change it to fit your own pi if you want to use these scripts.

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
